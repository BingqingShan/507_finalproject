                      The KJ Method                    ","
1. Set up a group meeting and a room. You need at least 5 participants to generate a sufficient amount of ideas.
2. Select a moderator. This moderator frames the design challenge.
3. Participants generate many ideas and write them on post-its.
4. Collect the idea post-its, shuffle them, and hand them out. No one should get one of their own ideas.
5. Ideas are read out as the moderator transcribes them on flipchart pages. During this phase, anyone can ask for clarification of any idea brought up and recorded. Ideas are categorized in groups (post the post-its on a wall or whiteboard). No more than 10 groups!
6. Best ideas are voted up, so that each group has clear winners. Discuss the insights.
7. Individuals take ownership of ideas and take responsibility for implementing or further developing each on a deadline.

1. Arrange a sheet of paper (or a digital artboard) and gather all the information you have at the moment.
2. Start clustering information and arrange it in groups.
3. Organise the information by drawing a circle and placing the clustered information in the circle.
4. Repeat the previous step for each of the information clusters.
5. Some information will overlap across different clusters, make sure you place the information in the intersection between the different circles.
6. Review if all the information has been placed, some information might have to be placed in a different cluster or a cluster will have to be divided in sub-clusters.
7. Analyse the diagram and polish the way it is displayed, this could be done quickly on paper or on a graphic design computer program.

1. Organize a team, and a room with materials, such as markers and flipboard sheets.
2. Deconstruct the product, think of the reasons why the product has its current form. Make a very clear description making sure you can identify the product on the description alone.
3. Deconstruct the interaction and describe it. Make sure you describe the interaction itself and not the product/user. An interaction could be warm, friendly, blobby, etc.
4. Deconstruct the context, think about the way the context has de ned the product, and categorize these into principles, states, developments and trends.
5. Make a selection and cluster the aspects you have uncovered that might affect your design, categorize them into principles, states, developments and trends.
7. Combine the elements into one (or many) coherent story(ies), these will be your context(s).

1. Analyze your stories. Make sure you understand how the principles, states, trends, developments and trends have shaped the product/service and how it fits in a context.
2. Write down your statement, this is what you aim to achieve with your design, for example I want people to feel happier during their daily commute.
3. Define the interactions that can promote, facilitate and enhance your statement, make and prioritize a list with them. Select the top 5 and explain why they are important.
4. Gather large sheets of paper, pencils and markers. Distribute among the participants.
5. Start sketching ideas based on your statement, and your desired interaction qualities. Keep in mind that there are many ways to achieve this, try different ways (lo- tech, high-tech, service, product, etc.)
