6. Best ideas are voted up, so that each group has clear winners. Discuss the insights.
7. Individuals take ownership of ideas and take responsibility for implementing or further developing each on a deadline.

3. Each individual identifies the scope of their literature review. What types of publications can you use (e.g., journals, books, government documents, popular media) and what area or discipline should you look into?
4. Each individual summarises their findings in a document, with reference to each source.
5. Organise a team meeting and discuss main findings. Make sure to develop a general summary of this discussion. The other information is not discarded, but archived elsewhere (for possible later reference).
